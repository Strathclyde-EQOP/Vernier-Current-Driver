# Vernier Current Driver

The Vernier Current Driver is an ultra low noise, programmable, bi-polar current source. It comes in two flavours:

1. Low Current Driver (LCD): designed to output current up to ~50 mA
2. High Current Driver (HCD): designed to output currents from ~50 mA to ~250 mA

# Performance

Three sample devices were tested. For full details, see the companion paper.

The headlines results:

|Configuration|CH1|CH2|CH3|
|---|---|---|---|
|LCD@10 mA<sub>MAX</sub> (10 ± 5 Hz average noise) | 32.9 pA√Hz | 34.0 pA√Hz | 30.0 pA√Hz |
|LCD@2.5 mA<sub>MAX</sub> (10 ± 5 Hz average noise) | 18.7 pA√Hz | 18.5 pA√Hz | 19.2 pA√Hz |
|HCD@250 mA<sub>MAX</sub> (10 ± 5 Hz average noise) | 933.8 pA√Hz | 915.5 pA√Hz | 909.9 pA√Hz |
|LCD@10 mA<sub>MAX</sub> (10 ± 5 Hz relative average noise) | 3.27 ppb√Hz | 3.39 ppb√Hz | 2.99 ppb√Hz |
